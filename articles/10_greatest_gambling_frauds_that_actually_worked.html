  <h1>10 Greatest Gambling Frauds That Actually Worked</h1>

<p>Gambling frauds are nothing new, but that doesn’t make them any less despicable. Over the
    years, there have been countless examples of individuals who have taken advantage of casinos
    and other gambling establishments for their own gain.

</p>
<h5>29July.2022</h5>
</div>
<img class="article-photo" src="img/10_greatest_gambling_frauds.jpg" alt="10 Greatest Gambling Frauds That Actually Worked">
<p>
    In any given year, casinos around the world lose millions of dollars to clever cheats and
fraudsters. While some scams are simple and easy to execute, others are more complex and
require a high level of technical expertise. Regardless of the method used, though, all gambling
frauds have one goal in mind: to take money away from the casino. Here are ten of the most
successful scams in history.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    1. The Frank Abagnale Scam
</h3>
<p>
    Frank Abagnale, who was only sixteen years old at the time, deceived Pan American Airlines
into believing that he was a pilot for the company in 1962. Over the course of the subsequent
five years, he cashed more than two million dollars worth of bogus cheques all over the world.
What&#39;s even more remarkable about that? He accomplished all mentioned above without ever
leaving the country.
<br><br>
How exactly did he manage to pull it off? By gambling. Abagnale discovered that casinos do not
always verify the legitimacy of checks, which allowed him to gamble using fraudulent checks
and subsequently cash in on his wins. Abagnale was able to use this information to his
advantage. He was subsequently caught by the FBI while attempting to pass a check for $8,000
at a casino in Monte Carlo.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    2. The Black Friday Scam
</h3>
<p>
    The findings of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission indicate that illegal gambling
enterprises are responsible for the loss of up to $3.5 billion yearly in the United States. These
frauds range from the relatively straightforward ones that target naive gamblers to the more
intricate ones that exploit the policies and procedures of casinos to their advantage. Even while
authorities in law enforcement are making a concentrated effort to put an end to these activities,
it appears that new frauds are being perpetrated on a daily basis.
<br><br>
One of the most common and pervasive forms of unethical gambling that can take place is
known as the &quot;advance-fee&quot; scam. A victim of this deception is given the impression that, in
exchange for an up-front payment of a modest fee, they will get a big payoff. The scam artist
will, of course, pocket all of the money for himself, and the victim will never see the prize
money they were promised. Yet another common type of fraudulent activity is the use of phoney
winning tickets. When potential victim is presented with what they believe to be a winning
lottery or casino ticket, they have fallen prey to this fraud.
</p>
<br>
<h3>3. The World Cup Ticket Scam</h3>
<p>
    Authorities have arrested more than a hundred people in connection with a global network of
gambling frauds, which is being labelled the largest scam involving World Cup tickets in the
history of the swindle. The arrests were carried out in a total of twelve different nations, three of
which were the United States, Russia, and Germany.
<br><br>
Fraudsters are accused of plotting a scam in which they would sell tickets to the World Cup even
though they did not actually hold any tickets themselves. In certain instances, they went so far as
to produce phoney tickets. After that, they collected payments from purchasers, who were often
assured that they would have seats in the pricier VIP areas of the stadiums. In point of fact, the
vast majority of these purchasers did not receive any tickets at all.
<br><br>
The authorities estimate that the con artists made more than one hundred million dollars from
their scheme. They also warn that a much larger number of people may have been duped but
have not yet come forward with the information.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    4. The Ponzi Scheme
</h3>
<p>
    When most people think of Ponzi schemes, they think of the high-profile investment frauds
perpetrated by Bernard Madoff and Allen Stanford. However, the Ponzi scheme is not limited to
just investment frauds. It can be used to describe any scheme in which money from new
investors is used to pay off earlier investors, with no legitimate underlying business or
investment activity taking place.
<br><br>
The first Ponzi scheme was created by Charles Ponzi in 1920. He promised investors a 50%
return on their investment within 45 days, based on what he claimed were special opportunities
to buy postage stamps abroad and sell them at a higher price in the United States. In reality,
Ponzi was simply paying off earlier investors with money from new investors. As long as there
were enough new investors coming in, Ponzi could keep the scheme going.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    5. The MIT Blackjack Team
</h3>
<p>
    In the 1980s, a group of students from MIT became known as the best blackjack players in the
world. They won millions of dollars from casinos by using sophisticated card counting
techniques. However, their success was not without controversy. In 1988, several members of
the team were indicted for cheating and conspiracy to commit fraud.
<br><br>
The MIT Blackjack Team trounced casinos and made millions of dollars counting cards from the
1970s through the 1990s.
<br><br>
An early blackjack team comprised of students and ex-students from prestigious universities like
MIT and Harvard used coordinated, scientific strategies in order to beat the casinos.
<br><br>
More than 100 blackjack players were taught by group mastermind Bill Kaplan, who allegedly
made $10 million for himself and investors at casinos all around the world, according to Inc.,
which called his card-counting &quot;frowned-upon yet legal.&quot;
<br><br>
Casinos eventually learned of the complex plan and began prohibiting the team&#39;s members from
gambling. The squad had largely disbanded by 1993, despite the fact that a few players
continued to play well into the 2000s. The movie &quot;21&quot; was based on the team&#39;s activities.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    6. Cannes Contact Lens Ruse
</h3>
<p>
    A gang of men from Cannes, France, were found in a local casino wearing contact lenses that hid
miniature cameras within them. The men were attempting to steal money from the casino. Their
objective was to keep track of the winning lottery numbers in a way that was not obvious. After
one of the men&#39;s contact lenses fell out throughout the course of the game, security authorities
were able to identify and apprehend the group. The incident occurred while the game was in
progress.
<br><br>
This specific method of cheating at gambling businesses has been attempted on multiple
occasions in the past as well. In the year 2012, a number of men from London were nabbed for
using identical technology to video the roulette wheel and predict the results of the game. These
individuals were caught in the act.
<br><br>
Because it is difficult to recognise contact lenses that have microscopic cameras attached to
them, casinos are currently increasing the security systems they have in place to prevent scams of
this nature. One of the reasons for this is that it is difficult to identify contact lenses that have
microscopic cameras attached to them.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    7. Restroom Roulette Scam
</h3>
<p>
    &quot;Restroom roulette&quot; is the name of a new con that is being perpetrated on people who frequently
visit casinos. The victim is contacted by a con artist while they are in the lavatory. The con artist
begs for the victim&#39;s assistance in reaching something that is located on the top shelf. While the
victim is assisting the con artist, the con artist replaces the victim&#39;s wallet with another wallet
that looks identical but does not contain any money. When the victim finally discovers they&#39;ve
been conned, the robber has already left with their money.
<br><br>
Gambling addicts are a common target for cons like this one, which is just one of many such
cons. Criminals who commit fraud frequently target individuals who are particularly susceptible
because they are desperate for financial gain. They take advantage of people&#39;s hopes and desires
by employing a range of deceitful techniques, such as phoney-winning tickets or slot machines
that have been tampered with.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    8. Richard Marcus’ Chip Stacking
</h3>
<p>
    Some participants in the high-stakes world of casino gambling are willing to do anything it takes
to come out on top. This includes strategies such as &quot;chip stacking,&quot; which are designed to give
the player an advantage over the house.
<br><br>
Stacking your chips, often known as &quot;chip stacking,&quot; is a method of cheating that includes
strategically laying your chips on the table in various patterns in order to give oneself an
advantage. For instance, you might arrange the chips on the table so that the largest stack is in
the middle, with a smaller stack next to it, and yet another little stack at the other end of the
table. Because of this, it is more difficult for the dealer or the other players to keep track of your
bets and any adjustments you make to the size of those bets.
<br><br>
In the majority of jurisdictions, chip stacking is considered a criminal offence that can lead to
incarceration or a significant fine. Stacking chips and other forms of cheating are taken very
seriously by casinos, which is why they employ teams of security professionals who are trained
to recognise these types of cheating.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    9. Phil Ivey&#39;s Edge Sorting
</h3>
<p>
    Poker players that play the game professionally often use a strategy known as &quot;edge sorting&quot; to
give themselves an advantage over their rivals. The strategy is used to determine which cards are
more likely to have a high or low value, and then bets are placed in accordance with those
predictions. Because of this, the player has a better chance of winning because they will be able
to make more educated choices on which cards to keep and which ones to throw away.
<br><br>
The practice of edge sorting has come under increased criticism in recent years as a result of
allegations that several players cheated their opponents by utilising the strategy. Phil Ivey was hit
with a lawsuit in 2012 by Crockfords Casino over allegations that he used edge sorting to win
$7.7 million from the gambling establishment. Ivey asserted that he had done nothing wrong;
however, the court found in favour of the casino and demanded that he pay back the money he
had won.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    10. The Tran Organization
</h3>
<p>
    The Tran Organization, a Vietnamese-American organised criminal ring, has been linked to a
gaming fraud scheme that has cost casinos in Las Vegas millions of dollars. This operation was
allegedly carried out by Vietnamese immigrants. As part of the scam, &quot;Asian high rollers&quot; were
recruited to put illicit bets in casinos across the country.
<br><br>
It is believed that the Tran Organization recruited these high rollers through various social media
platforms and then coached them on how to make their bets in a way that would keep them
hidden from authorities. It is also believed that the organisation used employees to function as
&quot;runners,&quot; who would collect the winnings from the high rollers. These persons were employed
by the organisation. According to reports, this con was carried out over the course of a number of

years, and it led to losses totalling more than thirteen million dollars for the casinos that were
involved.

        Conclusion 
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are those that participate in the realm of gambling and take the games very seriously, and
then there are people who try to take things to the next level by deceiving their way to financial
gain. There have been a few instances of fraudulent gambling schemes being successful, despite
the fact that the majority of schemes end in failure. The following is a list of the top ten gambling
cons that have actually been successful.
