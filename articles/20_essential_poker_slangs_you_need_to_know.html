    <h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:200%;">Poker Slangs</h2>
    <h3>1.Angle Shooting</h3>
<p>The act of seeking to gain an unfair advantage over other players by adopting techniques that are not legally prohibited but are still frowned upon is known as angle shooting and is a practice that is frowned upon. In most contexts, "shooting an angle" refers to this particular concept as the term that is being used. Players are considered to be engaging in unethical behavior if they either conceal the fact that they hold a strong hand during the showdown or make a false disclosure regarding the strength of their holdings.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>2.Arsenal</h3>
<p>A player's collection of strategies and movements is referred to as their "poker arsenal," another term that comes from the military. When you have access to a wide range of different plays, you have the power to throw off your opponents and make the most of any given circumstance. You will have more options to choose from if you have a deeper understanding of both the game and how to play it.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>3.Big Blind Special</h3>
<p>If you've ever watched a show about poker, chances are you've heard this expression more than a few times. The phrase "big blind special" is used to refer to a specific set of hole cards that is out of range for most players but which a player was able to see the flip with because they had the option to check in the big blind or were earning good odds on a call. This is because the player was in the position of the big blind.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>4.Bloodbath</h3>
<p>A "bloodbath" is a circumstance in which two or more players are likely to engage in a big pot, and poker analysts frequently use the term "bloodbath" to describe this scenario, despite the fact that it is a macabre term that is rarely employed. Because this circumstance typically arises when all of the players involved have a strong hand or powerful draw, it is quite possible that a number of players will be removed from the tournament or have a major portion of their stacks lowered if all of their chips are placed in the center.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>5.Busted</h3>
<p>When one's money is fully depleted, they are said to have "gone bust." It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as when a player is knocked out of a tournament because they have used up all of their chips. If you play a cash game and end up losing all of your money and are unable to pay to reload your account, you will run into the same issue. It is also possible that the player has used all of his funds and is unable to continue playing poker; in this scenario, the player is said to be "busted."</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>6.Chip Dumping</h3>
<p>Chip dumping is a strategy that can only be used in poker tournaments. In this strategy, a player will purposefully lose to another player in order to transfer chips from one stack to another. There are a lot of various reasons why people dump chips, but the most common one is collusion between two players in a tournament when one of them has accumulated a high stack and may "split" some of it with the other player. There are a lot of different reasons why players dump chips. In the event that players are caught dumping their chips, they run the risk of being kicked out of the tournament or having their money taken away from them.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>7.Clicking Buttons</h3>
<p>Even though it was originally used to describe playing poker online, the term "clicking buttons" is now often used to describe playing live as well. It's a term that's often used to refer to players who aren't paying attention or who don't know what they're doing, and it represents behavior that doesn't make any sense and is done just to do something. "Clicking buttons" can be best understood in the context of a player who, following an open and three callers, promptly makes a min-raise. Their raise not only accomplishes nothing of real value, but it also goes against all common sense and poker techniques.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>8.Credit Card Roulette</h3>
<p>Even while this isn't a poker term in and of itself, it's very likely that you've come across it a few times if you watch poker tournaments with large stakes online or listen to poker podcasts. The game, known as "credit card roulette," is a frequent way for people to decide who will pay for the tab (dinner, drinks, etc.). The credit card numbers are placed in a hat or box, and the person who pulls out the winning number is the one who is responsible for collecting the check. People will occasionally complain about the merciless and unpredictable nature of credit card roulette, even when they are playing for cash. This occurs even in cash games.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>9.Doomswitch</h3>
<p>A player who is now going through a rough patch and is currently on the unlucky side of variance is referred to as a "doomswitch," which is a word that originated in the world of online poker. Some people are under the impression that online poker sites are equipped with a "switch" that may be utilized to tilt the odds of certain players toward winning or losing. There is a small but loud minority of players who take these accusations seriously. The vast majority of players will view this as a joke, but there is a minority of players who take these claims seriously. They believe that in order to maintain a level playing field, the casino will stop paying out if you start winning too frequently. Don't get worked up over it; it's only an invention.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>10.Dirty Stack</h3>
<p>It is considered respectful, and in certain games, it is even obligatory to arrange your chips in a manner that makes it simple for other players to estimate how much money you have in the game. However, there are those players who just can't get enough of creating "dirty stacks," which are mounds of chips of varied denominations that have been jumbled together. You should make every effort to avoid this situation by maintaining your stacks in even amounts of goods so as to make your life easy (10, 20, 30, etc.).</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>11.Going South</h3>
<p>This strategy, which is technically considered to be unlawful and is sometimes referred to as an "angle shoot," is employed by some players in live poker cash games on occasion. You have probably been familiar with it in the past. When referring to the activity of removing chips from the table during a game of poker, the phrase "going south" is used. You are not permitted to remove any chips from the table while the game is still in progress in the vast majority of games. You are not permitted to simply pocket the money that you have won and walk away from the table, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>12.Idiot End</h3>
<p>A street that leads nowhere is called an idiot end in slang (draw). When a player has the lowest possible straight on the draw but choices for larger straights, they are said to be drawing to the idiot end of a straight. This phrase comes from the poker term "drawing to the idiot end of a flush." The word may be harsh, but it accurately describes the situation, which is that drawing to this kind of hand is almost always a losing gamble that costs you a significant amount of money.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>13.Lodden Thinks</h3>
<p>The card game known as "Lodden Thinks" was created by high-stakes poker professionals such as Antonio Esfandiari and Phil Laak. Even though it has nothing to do with poker, it is a common activity to engage in while players are waiting for their turn. People are willing to stake their money on the viewpoint of another individual over a specific topic. The participant who is "Lodden" will jot down their response, and the other players will place bets based on what they believe the "Lodden" player's answer will be. The fact that the response does not in any way have to be factual is what makes the game such a fun and entertaining activity. Because you have to guess what others are thinking, you need some background in psychology and the ability to "read" the expressions on people's faces. This is because you have to try to figure out what they are thinking.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>14.Nosebleeds</h3>
<p>In the poker industry, there are many stake levels, including micro stakes, small stakes, mid stakes, high stakes, and nosebleeds. Games with extremely high stakes are ones in which significant amounts of money are continually at risk of being lost. The cash games in Macau are where true nosebleeds can be found, as it is not unusual for players to win or lose several million dollars in the course of a single session.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>15.Nut Nut</h3>
<p>You should be familiar with the term "the nuts," which refers to the poker hand that is considered to be the finest possible hand in any particular situation. However, in poker parlance, a hand is said to be a "nut nut" if it is both the nuts and has the potential to improve to even better nuts. This signifies the progression to the next level. A flipped nut straight, for example, can provide you the possibility of drawing the finest flush imaginable. This type of hand is referred to as a "nut nut" among poker players.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>16.Runner Runner</h3>
<p>This indicates that in order for you to complete your hand, you required a hit on the turn as well as a hit on the river. In the event that you have two clubs but there is only one club shown on the flop, you will need to strike a club on the turn as well as another club on the river in order to complete your flush. As a consequence of this, you are currently in the draw for a runner-runner flush.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>17.Shark</h3>
<p>The polar opposite of a "donkey" is a "shark," which refers to an aggressive and skillful player. A skilled player who hunts less experienced players and takes advantage of the mistakes they make is known as a "shark." In poker lingo, a "shark" is typically a term used to refer to a dependable professional player. The term "card shark" refers to a player who is proficient in a wide range of card games; it is not exclusive to poker players.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>18.Shill</h3>
<p>A "shill" is an advocate who promotes a company or product in an effort to alter the opinions of customers in a positive direction. This can be done for the purpose of financial gain. In the world of poker, forum users who defend particular poker rooms and their behavior by offering fake testimonials in an effort to mislead other players are referred to as "shills," and the term "shill" is often used to refer to these individuals.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>19.Tanking</h3>
<p>Tanking is a term that has its roots in the military and refers to a player who deliberates over a decision for an extended amount of time. It is also commonly known as "going into the tank," which is another name for the concept. Tanking is a common strategy that poker players use when they are faced with a hefty bet on the turn or river when the outcome of the hand could have a substantial effect on their finances. It is crucial to note that many members of the poker community are currently annoyed by players who tank by taking an excessive amount of time to make even little decisions (also known as "tanking"), and many have been outspoken about their discontentment.</p>
<br><br>
     <h3>20.Walking Chips</h3>
<p>During the course of a tournament, a participant may, at some point, assume that they have accumulated enough chips to take a break and explore the tournament area. Despite the fact that this is almost never the best move from a strategic point of view, this decision may arise at some point. In response to questions, players frequently assert that they have "walking chips," also known as sufficient funds to go away from the table for a bit and skip certain hands without risking losing everything. If you are participating in a satellite tournament (a tournament in which the winner earns a free entrance to a higher-level tournament) and you have a substantial chip stack, then you should consider doing that. In light of the fact that you are unaware of what lies ahead, maintaining the position in which you are currently sitting is another option worth considering.</p>
