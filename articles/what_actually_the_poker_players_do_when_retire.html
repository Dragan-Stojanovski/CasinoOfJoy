  <h1>What Actually the Poker Players Do When They Retire?</h1>

<p>Professional poker players may enjoy a better working life than the rest of us, but at some point, they'll have to hang up their chips and retire like the rest of us. After devoting a significant amount of their time and energy to perfecting their craft, what happens when a poker player ultimately sets down their chips?

</div>
<h2>Retirementâ€¦ What Exactly Is the Real Significance of It?</h2>
<p>
    The vast majority of those who frequently played poker before retirement continued to do so after they stopped working. The vast majority of persons who formerly competed in poker tournaments on a professional level eventually give up the game, although they may occasionally continue to play for enjoyment. 
<br><br>The same thing happened with Fedor Holz, who prematurely announced his retirement yet continued to compete in tournaments with the greatest stakes all around the world despite having already retired. When poker player "retires," they often stop playing the game professionally. However, this does not mean that they will never play poker again in the future. 
<br><br>Successful players frequently make it a point to consider the game a hobby in their spare time. This is because of the level of dedication they have to the game.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Popular Careers After Retiring From Poker</h2>
<p>
    If they win enough money to pay out, poker players in their twenties probably won't spend the rest of their lives doing nothing but counting their chips. They are thinking about shifting into a different professional field. 
    <br><br>In many instances, they have acquired valuable skills that can be applied to new fields with a high likelihood of achieving tremendous success. Therefore, the question "just what are those domains?" must be asked.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Business</h3>
<p>Before hanging up their cleats, many professional players build considerable nest eggs, which they can then use in various sectors once they have retired from their respective sports. A significant number of the players I knew have since departed the industry to launch their own companies or to collaborate with others working in this sector. 
    <br><br>  Let's take Fedor Holz as an example to help demonstrate this point. Making his enormous fortune at the tables cleared the path for him to enter the world of business. In conjunction with a leading performance coach, he developed an application known as PrimedMind. Additionally, he is in the process of creating a community center in Vienna. All things considered, he appears to be succeeding in a number of different endeavors.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Investing</h3>
<p>
    Poker players who are successful at the game have the financial resources necessary to pursue a less active professional path, such as investing in the purchase of an existing business. In this way, they will be able to avoid beginning from scratch, which will save both time and work. 
    <br><br>The previous year, I had the opportunity to speak with Alex Millar, one of the world's top high-stakes cash game players, and he informed me that he intends to follow in your footsteps. He stated, "I want to discover those segments of the market that are not very efficient so that I may gain an advantage and be able to spend my time working from home." 
    <br><br>He was referring to the ineffectiveness of certain market segments. The world of investing is an excellent place to watch the techniques of these smart minds in action as they look for any edge they can get their hands on.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Trading</h3>
<p>
    Stock trading is often successful for individuals that seek more out of their professions than simply take a passive role in the process. This is mostly due to the many similarities between chess and the game of poker, such as the requirement to assess circumstances, calculate probabilities, and make decisions while suppressing one's emotions. 
    <br><br> Example: Vanessa Selbst, the world's most recognized female poker player, chose to go in this direction and is now working as trading research and strategy analyst for a hedge fund. Her live tournament wins total over $11 million. After a successful career, athletes who have amassed a wide variety of skills that are in demand have a wide variety of options available to them once their playing days are over.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Poker Abilities That Are Transferable To Other Contexts</h2>
<p>When it comes time to hang up their cards, poker players are faced with the question of how best to put their skills to use. </p>
<br>
<h3>1.Concentrating on What You Can Control</h3>
<p>
    Poker is a game that will teach you directly to just concentrate on the things you have control over. Instead of focusing on the short-term volatility and "unlucky" swings that it can bring, a great poker player will instead focus on decision-making and honing their game, both of which will benefit them in any endeavor they do.
</p>
<br>
<h3>2.Ability to Detach From Emotions</h3>
<p>
    Making a decision on the spur of the moment based on how you are feeling is one of the most expensive mistakes you can make. If you want to be good at poker, you need to learn how to separate your sentiments from the actions that you make entirely. 
    <br><br>  Your responsibility is to think about all the information available to you and make a decision based on that evaluation; you shouldn't base your decision on things that happened in the past that made you angry but are no longer relevant. When you play poker, one of the most significant challenges you'll face is learning to get over your ego.
</p>
<br>
<h3>3.Patience and Dealing With Pressure</h3>
<p>
    It is obvious that the person making such a claim has never participated in the game of poker. When big amounts of money are at stake, and every option has implications, you are put under a lot of pressure to make the proper decision; but, despite this pressure, you are still required to evaluate the situation and make a decision regarding what to do next. 
    <br><br>At the poker table, you can acquire transferable practical skills such as being calm under pressure and waiting for the appropriate opportunity to act that can be applied to any other endeavor.
</p>
<br>
<h3>4.Risk Management</h3>
<p>
    Poker is a game of odds, and becoming an expert at managing the trade-offs between danger and potential gain can be quite helpful. If you are aware of this context, you will be able to more precisely assess the possible rewards against the hazards that are involved with the situation. 
    <br><br>Even when the conditions are perfect for making money, many people who would otherwise make intelligent decisions avoid making investments because they are afraid of losing their money. Poker may teach you how to evaluate circumstances such as these as well as many others.
</p>
<br>
<h3>5.Money Management</h3>
<p>
    The player's bankroll is one of the most significant tools for long-term success in poker, and it needs to be handled according to strict criteria for the player to enjoy continuous financial success. If you are playing poker or just living your life, it is helpful to plan ahead and adhere to specified principles. 
    <br><br>This can help you avoid numerous problems. Even if you are a brilliant player, if you start playing at a level that is too high for your skill level, you have a considerable chance of losing all of your money.
</p>
<br>
<h3>6.Reading Other People</h3>
<p>
    The interpersonal skills you train when playing poker can come in handy when negotiating for a raise, a new investment, or just about anything else. While this benefit may not be as important as others, it can nonetheless be helpful. You'd be hard-pressed to find a professional field in which having knowledge of how to play poker wouldn't offer you an advantage over the other candidates.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Moves Made by Some of the Best Poker Players</h2>
<p>
    Some of the top poker players in the world have made the decision to leave the casino card game and pursue other opportunities. Phil Gordon was a well-known and respected player on the international poker circuit. Before launching his digital messaging business site Chatbox, he collected a total of $2.78 million in earnings over his poker career and won the World Poker Tour. 
    <br><br><strong>Antanas Gouga (Tony G)</strong>, formerly a professional poker player, decided to pursue a different line of work and instead ran for a seat in the European Parliament. After he felt forced to pursue politics, he retired with more than $7.2 million in earnings and moved on to other ventures instead of continuing his political career. 
    <br><br>In addition, poker has had its fair share of controversies, which has finally led some players to hang up their chips. Annie Duke formerly held the record for the most money won by a female poker player in the history of the game. In addition to winning more than $4.2 million in tournament prize money, she also took home a bracelet from the World Series of Poker. 
    <br><br>After the Epic Poker League was unable to find success, she decided to switch jobs and became a motivational speaker and life coach. Duke is one of a number of athletes whose careers were cut short due to scandals at their respective institutions. As the investigation revealed that even high-profile employees such as Howard Lederer, Chris Ferguson, and Russ Hamilton were involved in the scandal, it became clear that quitting was the best course of action to take.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Retirement... Choose Your Own Adventure!</h3>
<p>
    After taking a break from playing poker for an extended length of time, some people find that they miss the game's excitement and rivalry and decide to return to it full-time. In addition, a subset of professional poker players still plays the game on a recreational level. These players are known as "amateurs." 
    <br><br>In my opinion, Doug Polk is the most compelling example. Although he no longer played poker professionally, he was constantly working on his instructional website and YouTube channel. There are a lot of players who follow this approach, and they do things like create blogs, write books, and come up with different ways to keep in touch with the poker community. 
    <br><br>They have a decent possibility of achieving success in their new field of work if they are able to dedicate themselves to it fully. Talents such as the capacity to "read" people, "analyze" decisions, and "take measured risks" are all transferrable skills that can help individuals be successful in other areas of business as well. Poker is appealing for a variety of reasons, and this is one of them. In a similar vein, no two people's hands are completely identical to one another.

<h3>
    When Is the Appropriate Time to Start Thinking About Retiring?
</h3>
<p>
    Poker players are in the same category as those people who may be able to retire a significant amount of time before the rest of us. Poker is commonly seen as a profession that can be passed down from one generation to the next and now provides its players with significant financial incentives. 
    <br><br>Because they are now able to amass a fortune at a younger age, players may now give more serious consideration to retiring at an earlier age. In addition, poker is quickly becoming a viable profession for an increasing number of younger individuals. Some players invest a lot of time and effort into learning the game before they start playing seriously in real casinos. 
    <br><br>These players take advantage of the many resources available to them to acquire advanced strategies or study using an artificial intelligence software. Additionally, some websites offer practice or demonstration games that can give you a feel for the game without actually teaching you any strategy. 
    <br><br>These games can be helpful in gaining a general understanding of the game. I wouldn't recommend doing that, but I have heard accounts of people who play poker when they are too young to do so legally but who use an account belonging to a buddy to hone their skills despite this fact. 
    <br><br>They have access to every available resource, and because of multi-tabling and the pace of online poker, they can play many more hands than live players can. As a result, they are making huge strides in a short amount of time. They will have more experience than some of the warriors who have been fighting for years by the time they reach the age where it is permissible for them to bet in casinos. 
    <br><br>This is because they will have reached that age earlier. Pius Heinz and Peter Eastgate are just two of the fortunate individuals who have won significant amounts of money at the World Series of Poker Main Event. They were consequently in a position to agree upon an urgent retirement strategy.
