  <h1>Poker Terms Fully Explained</h1>

<p>There is a wide variety of jargon unique to the casino world, with the card game Poker being a prime example. The more a player knows about the Poker lingo, the more effective they will be at the game. Let's help your poker game along by emphasising the most frequently used and critically important terms and their definitions.

</div>
<div class="poker-terms">
<h3>ACTION</h3>
<p>
    When it's your turn to do something in hand. OR To place a wager or increase the stakes. OR As a noun, it describes a game where the stakes are high, and the action is intense.
</p>
<br>
<h3>ANTE</h3>
<p>A mandatory pre-hand bet that each player must make in order to receive a hand. In poker, an ante is similar to a blind, except that it's obligatory for all players to put in money before the hand even begins. Antes assign an initial value to the pot.</p>
<br>
<h3>BACKDOOR</h3>
<p>Making a winning hand by drawing the necessary cards on the turn and river. You have a "backdoor" flush if there is only one heart on the board, you have two hearts in your hand, and two more hearts appear on the turn and river.
</p><br>

<h3>BAD BEAT</h3>
<p>When a player with a large chip lead at the beginning of the hand loses the pot on the flop, turn, or river to a player with a smaller chip lead.
</p><br>
<h3>BIG BLIND</h3>
<p>The amount of chips that must be possessed by the player who has positioned two seats to the left of the dealer. The amount is decided based on the stakes. It functions in a manner very comparable to the ante in that a fixed sum is added to the pot prior to the start of the action. It is the same as placing a wager on the whole of the first round. The act of betting in poker when one does not have access to the deck is referred to as "blind" betting, and it is denoted by the term "blind."
</p><br>
<h3>BLIND</h3>
<p>This word can refer to either the big blind or the small blind in poker. It is used interchangeably in the game. The small blind and the big blind are placed in either one space to the left of the dealer button or two spots to the left of the button, respectively (big blind).
</p><br>
<h3>BUBBLE</h3>
<p>The bubble indicates the point beyond which a player will be disqualified from the competition and eliminated from the event. The place at the absolute bottom of the scoreboard is referred to as "the bubble" when only the top 45 finishers in a tournament win prize money.
</p><br>
<h3>BURN</h3>
<p>Before each new round of betting, the card on top of the deck is thrown away. If the card on top of the deck is marked in any way, the card underneath it won't be revealed until it is either played or burned. This ensures that no information that is dishonest or deceptive is disseminated in any way.
</p><br>
<h3>CALL</h3>
<p>To put just enough money into the pot so that play can continue without stopping.
</p><br>
<h3>CHECK</h3>
<p>The decision not to gamble. There is no need to make a call if there is no action (bet) in your favour. You can "check" if you don't want to make a bet. If other players take further action in the betting round, the action will come back to you to call, fold, or raise.
</p><br>
<h3>COLD CALL</h3>
<p>Calling two or more bets on a turn. You are cold calling if the pot has already been bet and raised before you enter the hand.
</p><br>
<h3>COUNTERFEIT</h3>
<p>Because the deck contains one duplicate card, your chances of winning are significantly lower than they would otherwise be. You are considered to have been "counterfeited" if you possess a pair of sixes, but the board contains an ace, ace, seven, and four, and the river card is a seven. When you first began, no one on the board had any cards that were better than a pair; nevertheless, there are now two players competing against you. Now that you have a card lower than a 6, your hand is weaker than the hands of everyone else who has a card higher than a 6.</p><br>

<h3>DRAW</h3>
<p>Deciding to continue playing with one hand with the expectation of future success with that hand. You do not yet have a complete hand, but you are one card away from completing a straight or flush with the help of the remaining card. In poker, to "draw" implies calling a wager round (or raising the stakes) in the expectation of receiving the needed card (s). Draws that result in a flush (a flush draw) or a straight (a straight draw) are the two circumstances that occur the most frequently (drawing for a straight). You can also draw if you have three of a kind, a complete house, or a stronger hand.
</p><br>
<h3>DRAW OUT</h3>
<p>A card that turns a losing hand into a winning one.
</p><br>
<h3>DRAWING DEAD</h3>
<p>You keep drawing cards, but there isn't a single one that will give you a winning hand. When your opponent already has four of a kind, and you have two pairs hoping to make a full house on the river, you are said to be "drawing dead."
</p><br>
<h3>FLOP</h3>
<p>After the initial round of betting is complete, the dealer will reveal the first three community cards.
</p><br>
<h3>FLUSH</h3>
<p>The poker hand made up of five cards, all of the same suit.
</p><br>
<h3>FOLD</h3>
<p>To surrender by putting all of one's cards face down on the table and thereby forfeiting all of one's bets. If you have a weak hand compared to the other players, you should only fold.
</p><br>
<h3>FOUR OF A KIND</h3>
<p>A hand in which all four cards are of the same value.
</p><br>
<h3>FULL HOUSE</h3>
<p>A combination of a straight flush and a pair.
</p><br>
<h3>HAND</h3>
<p>A hand consists of five cards, two from each player's hand and three from the table.
</p><br>
<h3>HEADS-UP</h3>
<p>Competing in a tournament or pot against a single opponent.
</p><br>
<h3>IMPLIED ODDS</h3>
<p>Coming to a conclusion while bearing in mind the possible moves that other players may make throughout the game. Hand signals are reliable indicators of intent if you have the ability to draw. The phrase "implied" is fair to use when describing the state of these monies because they are not yet in the middle and won't be until after you hit your card and they call your bets.
</p><br>
<h3>KICKER</h3>
<p>In the event that two or more players enter the showdown with the same hand, the player with the highest kicker will win the pot. You would win the hand against an opponent who held a king and a queen if you held an ace and a king and the board contained 7-7-5-5-2. Your "kicker" is equivalent to a trump card. In this particular situation, the difference between winning and losing is exclusively determined by the highest card in hand consisting of five cards.
</p><br>
<h3>LATE POSITION</h3>
<p>A player's position on a betting round in which he or she must take action after the majority of players have already done so (usually considered to be the two positions next to the button).
</p><br>
<h3>LIMP</h3>
<p>Slang term for calling that suggests the speaker is not trying to provoke a response.</p><br>
<h3>LIMIT</h3>
<p>A betting and raising structure in which players are limited to a certain bankroll.</p><br>

<h3>LIVE BET</h3>
<p>Refers to making a phone call but suggests it is not an aggressive action.</p><br>

<h3>MUCK</h3>
<p>The total of a hand's discards. As soon as a player folds, his hand is said to be thrown "into the muck."</p><br>

<h3>NO-LIMIT</h3>
<p>Playing with one's entire chip stack is permitted in this variant of the game. The maximum amount you can wager is undefined, but there is a minimum.</p><br>

<h3>NUTS</h3>
<p>The state that is ideal at the moment is represented by NUTS. For example, if you have pocket sevens and the flop consists of sevens, twos, and a pair, you have the "nuts" because you have just made trip sevens, which is the best possible hand in poker. If the turn card is a 5, you will no longer have the best hand; instead, the honour will go to the player who has an eight or a nine and is building a straight. If the river card is a 7, and you have the best hand conceivable, you will take the lead in the game.</p><br>

<h3>SATELLITE</h3>
<p>A tournament with a low buy-in, the prize for which is not cash but rather entry into a larger event. [Not to be confused with a satellite tournament.] One player will earn a spot in the satellite tournament if there are 20 participants in the $500 satellite, and the reward is a seat in the $10,000 WSOP.com Main Event. Players have the opportunity to compete in a larger, more expensive event by first qualifying for a smaller, less expensive tournament known as a "satellite."</p><br>
<h3>SET</h3>
<p>Having a pair in your pocket that improves to a full house on the board.</p><br>
<h3>SHOWDOWN</h3>
<p>Showdown refers to the last stage of a poker game in which all bets have been placed, and players disclose their hands. It is necessary for there to be callers during the final betting round or for an all-in to take place prior to the final betting round for a poker hand to proceed to the showdown stage.</p><br>

<h3>SIT-AND-GO</h3>
<p>A poker tournament in which the start time is contingent on the number of entrants. You first "sit" (register) and then "go" (start) once there are enough other players to play.</p><br>

<h3>SIT OUT</h3>
<p>This is the action taken when you decide to leave a table for a few hands. A player is eliminated if they have been inactive for more than fifteen minutes or have missed two rounds of blinds.</p><br>

<h3>SLOW PLAY</h3>
<p>When you play your hand less aggressively than necessary in the hopes that other players will stay and possibly call your bets. A full house on the flop, for instance, is almost unbeatable. If you play the hand slowly, the other players may have time to make hands and raise your bets.</p><br>

<h3>STRADDLE</h3>
<p>If they so want, the player sitting to the left of the large blind has the opportunity to place an ante wager before the cards are dealt. The straddle bet is equal to double the size of the big blind (same as a legal raise). The player in the straddle position receives the "option" from the big blind. It's possible that he'll make another bid when it's his turn. The straddle is a frequent tactic used in cash games; however it is often disallowed when playing in tournaments.</p><br>

<h3>STRING BET</h3>
<p>Staggering or making multiple motions to place a bet on the table. If the dealer suspects that a wager is part of a string, he will cancel the wager and return any additional funds. It's against the rules because you could use it to test the waters before committing the full amount of your raise to see how other players react.</p><br>
<h3>TELL</h3>
<p>A player's physical behaviour or betting pattern can be read as indicating the strength of their hand. The best poker players are able to read their opponents' tells and react accordingly.
</p><br>
<h3>TIME</h3>
<p>I require a little bit more time in order to find out what's going on. A player has the option of requesting additional time in order to avoid the dealer from giving up on the hand due to the player's lack of participation. On the other hand, in the event that a player takes an excessively long amount of time to make a choice, the other players may resort to utilising the "clock" on them in an effort to keep the game going forward.
</p><br>
<h3>TOP PAIR</h3>
<p>The highest possible pair at the table. A "top pair" with an ace kicker would be something like an ace and a 7 in the hole on a 3-4-7 flop. An over-pair is any two cards that total more than seven.
</p><br>
<h3>TRIPS</h3>
<p>Means "three of a kind" in informal usage.
</p><br>
<h3>TURN</h3>
<p>This is the fourth shared card. Displayed upright and alone. Commonly referred to as "Fourth Street."
